│   ├── Counter: $20 (You)

- Check worker's ratings and portfolio

- Propose win-win alternatives

### Example Negotiation Flow

**Round 1:**
```
Job: "Need logo design - Budget: $100"
Offer: "$75 + I'll throw in business card design"
```

**Round 2:**
```
Counter: "$85 for logo only, business cards separate project"
Response: "$80 + simple business card template - deal?"
```

**Round 3:**
```
Acceptance: "Perfect! Let's do it. When can you start?"
Status: → IN_PROGRESS
```
